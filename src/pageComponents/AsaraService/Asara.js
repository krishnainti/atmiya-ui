                  Asara is an unique program to help MS Students in US and MS
                  aspiring students in India. ASARA is all about connecting the
                  dots for new students from airport pickups,accommodation help,
                  career guidance and job search. This is a great service for
                  youth to leverage as most of them land in US with minimum
                  guidance and rather than learning it the hard way , as fellow
                  community members we can help them overcome those initial
                  impediments.
